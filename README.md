# MORE ABOUT B.C. ROBOTICS
Blount County Robotics 4504 started out in 2013 with just a few people coming together to do what they love. Little did they know that it would grow into the thriving team it is today. Our dedicated members enjoy meeting often for different events and activities. Passion and enthusiasm go hand-in-hand with everything we do. Our door is always open to new members, no matter their experience level. We are proud to bring together people from all over Blount County. Come join us at our next event — we’d love to share all that BCR 4504 has to offer.
